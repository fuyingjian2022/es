## What is the difference between the hardness,toughness
Apr 27,2018&nbsp&#0183&#32Hardness is the measurement of how much a material resists to penetration from a semistatic force.It is tested for with an indenter hardness machine usually (but not solely) by measuring the size of the indentation after releasing the load.TheMaterials Science and Engineering EngineeringMaterials Science and Engineering.A unique and multidisciplinary contribution.Materials engineers make a unique contribution not just by making new materials,but also by improving what we already have.Here at Monash,our graduates and researchers are making things stronger,lighter,more functional,more sustainable and more cost
