## What welding process should I use on cast iron? TWI
Many MMA consumables for cast iron welding have special coatings to minimise arc penetration.Less penetrating arcs,and low heat input levels can be achieved with metal inert gas (MIG) and metal active gas (MAG) welding (referred to as GMAW in the United States),especially if the dip transfer process is used.Guide to Casting and Molding ProcessesGuide to Casting and Molding Processes.it possible to use this process with all types of green sand molding equipment and for a majority of alloys poured.
