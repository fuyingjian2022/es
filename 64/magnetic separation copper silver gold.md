Shawn Pure gold is not magnetic.That is,it doesn't form a magnet on its own.If you put it in a magnetic field it will magnetize a tiny bit,but only so long as it's in the field.and the direction of the magnetizaqtion makes it weakly repel the magnet.There are alloys of gold,for example gold with more than about 20% of the atoms replaced by iron,which do magnetize on their own,atmagnetic separation copper silver gold copper pulverizerCopper (Cu) is an extremely useful industrial metal that is ductile (capable of being drawn into wire),malleable (capable of being hammered and molded) and an excellent conductor of electricity (only the silver.
