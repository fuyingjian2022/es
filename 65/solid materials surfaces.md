## Solid surface Wikipedia
Performance characteristics.Solid surface is a non porous low maintenance material used for surfaces such as countertops.It can mimic the appearance of granite,marble,stone,and other naturally occurring materials,and can be joined nearly invisibly by a trained craftsman.Typically manufactured in sheet form for fabrication into finished countertops,solid surface can also be cast into a.Surface energy WikipediaSurface free energy or interfacial free energy or surface energy quantifies the disruption of intermolecular bonds that occurs when a surface is created.In the physics of solids,surfaces must be intrinsically less energetically favorable than the bulk of a material (the molecules on the surface have more energy compared with the molecules in the bulk of the material),otherwise there would.
