## Longwall Mining Overview Introduction
longwall mining Overview In the method of secondary extraction known as longwall mining a relatively long mining face (typically in the range 100 to 300m but may be longer) is created by driving a roadway at right angles between two roadways that form the sides of the longwall block,with one rib of this new roadway forming the longwall face.A General Review on Longwall MiningInduced Fractures in201873&ensp&#0183&enspIntroduction.Longwall mining is the most common method of underground coal mining all over the world.During the retreating of the longwall face,the primary equilibrium state is disturbed and,as a result,the surrounding rocks are unavoidably broken or fractured.
