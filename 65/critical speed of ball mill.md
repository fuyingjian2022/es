## Ball Mill: Operating principles,components,Uses
A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis.The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 50% of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.Correlations for the grindability of the ball mill as a measure of itstime of grinding,particle density,and speed of the ball mill (rpm).An attempt has been.rotation speed is called the &#39critical speed&#39 (nc).This phenomenon is

## What is critical speed of a SAG mill answers
The critical speed of a SAG mill is the speed in RPM's at which centrifugal force causes the material being ground to be held against the inside of the shell.When setting up a ball mill,itEffects of Mill Speed on Kinetic Breakage Parameters of FourAdditionally,in this study it was found that optimum grinding occurs at φc = 85% for all pumice samples,in contrast to the 75% of critical speed of the ball mill.
