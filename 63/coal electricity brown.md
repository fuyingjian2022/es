## Coal National Geographic Society
Coal is a black or brownishblack sedimentary rock that can be burned for fuel and used to generate electricity.It is composed mostly of carbon and hydrocarbons,which contain energy that can be released through combustion (burning).Coal is the largest source of energy for generating electricity in the world,and the most abundant fossil fuel in the United States.Coal Facts,Uses,&amp Types BritannicaCoal: Coal,one of the most important primary fossil fuels,a solid carbonrich material,usually brown or black,that most often occurs in stratified sedimentary deposits,which may later be subjected to high temperatures and pressures during mountain building,resulting in
