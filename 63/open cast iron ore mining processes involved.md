## How iron is made material,manufacture,making,history
The European iron workers knew the Easterners had better iron,but not the processes involved in fashioning stronger iron products.The first known European breakthrough in the production of cast iron,which led quickly to the first practical steel,did not come until 1740.1 Much of the world's iron ore is extracted through open pitBasics of an open pit mine Mine Engineer.Com201316&ensp&#0183&enspThe definition of a open pit mine is &quotan excavation or cut made at the surface of the ground for the purpose of extracting ore and which is open to the surface for the duration of the mine's life.&quot To expose and mine the ore,it is generally necessary to excavate

## Open Pit Mining TechniquesSurface MinesRock or Mineral
Openpit mines are characteristically engorged until either the mineral resource is exhausted,or a mounting ratio of overburden to ore makes more mining uneconomic.When this occurs,the exhausted mines are at times converted to landfills for disposal of solid wastes.Copper Mining &amp Extraction Process Flow Chart201965&ensp&#0183&enspThis flowchart made of machinery icons explains or expresses in simple but clear terms the step of the Copper Mining and Copper Extraction Process.Starting from either openpit or underground mining and using a different relevant treatment method for oxide or sulphide copper mineral (ore).Having a quick look now at how porphyry ores are treated and the metals extracted.
